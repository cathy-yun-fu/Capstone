serious of the two films that were

about a good priest who helped cri-
minals in New York. His goodness, how-
ever, was not enough to prevent one
of them from being sent to the gas
chamber; and Philip and I waited with
Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
crying and could face the light of a golden
evening.
