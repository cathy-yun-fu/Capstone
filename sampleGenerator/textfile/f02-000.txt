The numerically largest group, consisting of male
weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
and in the works only, excluding the offices, was
therefore selected. A detailed age-structure was
compiled from personnel department records,
revealing that there were (at that time) seven-
teen men seventy years of age or older,
thirty-three aged sixty-four years, and sixty-
five just fifty years of age.
