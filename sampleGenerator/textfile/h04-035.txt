Consumption by younger childless couples declined
throughout this period, but that of the smaller families was
maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest
families, particularly those containing four or more children,
there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated scales of family
allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare
milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957.
