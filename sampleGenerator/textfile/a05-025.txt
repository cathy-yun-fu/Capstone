Criticisms about Army manpower appear
to have come mainly from retired officers
who have held high positions but
are out of touch with the existing situation.
Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir
Francis Festing, who believes completely
in the principle of an all-Regular army.
Gen. Sir Richard Hull, who is to succeed
Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr.
Watkinson is right.
