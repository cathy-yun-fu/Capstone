&quot;My white or my black?&quot; Nigel enquired.
&quot;Now I wonder which I wore at that
particular surgery?&quot; &quot;You are a fool,
darling,&quot; Di said happily. &quot;I shall take
great pleasure in telling that young man
exactly what you were doing that
evening.&quot; &quot;No, don't,&quot; he said, after
kissing her again. &quot;I rather like to have
the housemen think of me as a
two-timing Don Juan.
