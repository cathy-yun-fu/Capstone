More modest premises are provided on the upper floors over
shops in some of the town centres for the small type of
office organisation. Government departments with branches
established or about to be established in the new towns include
Her Majesty's Stationery Office at Basildon, the Meteorological
Office at Bracknell, the Admiralty (who have a research labora-
tory at Harlow), the General Post Office and the Ministry of
Transport at Hemel Hempstead and the Department of Scien-
tific and Industrial Research at Stevenage.
