Some development corporations have sought
to attract private investors by leasing part
of the shopping area to companies experienced
in commercial development who have #
undertaken the building and letting of the
shops. But corporations have generally found it
more satisfactory to build themselves, leasing the
shops to traders, with breaks in the lease to
enable rents to be increased in scale with
the rising prosperity of the town.
