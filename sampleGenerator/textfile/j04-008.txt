The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
ingrowth over two half-lives (ten days). Therefore
after a further forty days, the bismuth daughter
will be within 0.1 sources are required for use sooner
than forty or fifty days after preparation, the
lead-210 together with added lead carrier must
be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
ion exchange (see Analytical Method, steps 4, 5)
before precipitating lead chromate.
