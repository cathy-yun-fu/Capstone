'HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day?' His mother came into
the hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably
and, turning his back to her, contrived to slide the brief-
case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
brella stand. 'You're later than usual, aren't you?'
His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
for the labels from half a hundredweight of
Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea.
