She had loved Byron, but she had
betrayed him, betrayed him not twice, as
he had betrayed her, but again and again
over a long span of time, fawning on his
implacable wife, purveying to her in secret
the unguarded letters he never suspected
any eye but her own would see, feeding
the stealthy fires of her animosity: and
having betrayed him, she had grown to fear
and almost to hate him.
