No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I
mean that. I'd very probably be unfaithful and
that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach
you a lesson. It wouldn't work. You'd do it to
spite me. I would never do it for that reason.
To me it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate
or not. You'd go crazy if that situation arose.
