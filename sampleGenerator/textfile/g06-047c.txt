This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two
later as 'more like a God upon earth than
a human being', had an increasing number of
disciples among unorthodox medical men in the
cities of Europe. One of these was the
Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey
consulted in May 1834.
