Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
work in connection with Higher Religious Education, and
to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
Union. This meant organizing lectures and courses of
religious instruction through the Diocese, and I
also found myself a member of the Diocesan
Conference, where I remember introducing myself as
the incumbent of the highest church in the
Diocese.
