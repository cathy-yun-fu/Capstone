I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
handsome offer so I chimed in too. &quot;That
goes for me, gentlemen,&quot; I said. &quot;If they do try
and hold up the stage, it'll be a couple or
three of them, no more. I reckon we can deal
with them all right.&quot;
