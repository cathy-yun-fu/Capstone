Should the Herald publish such advertisements?
This is a difficult question. It would obviously
be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
which we disagree. When an advertisement
contains statements whose factual truth is
doubtful, or where the total content would be
deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to
exercise editorial discretion. The MRA
advertisement falls into neither category, though
many readers will dislike it.
