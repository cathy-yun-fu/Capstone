At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
was able to identify a photograph of the
girl, and he said he had last seen her
on platform six waiting to board
a train for the short run to Victoria.
A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
a young lady &quot;as near as possible&quot;
like the photograph shown him, with
a man &quot;very close in conversation and
walking arm in arm.&quot;
