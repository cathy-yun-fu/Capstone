Who will speak for Belgium? Who else but
Britain. We have fought beside Belgium
in two world wars. We are allies still.
Britain should champion Belgium. Not
with the careful, hooded language of diplomacy,
but boldly and fearlessly. It is time to
show the world that this country does not
desert her friends. HAPPY, happy
families! Never before have Britain's
larders been so well stocked.
