As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
more per calorie than the national average, and families
with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only
substantial change was in families with three children,
for whom the index declined from 91 to 88. Table 27
also shows the corresponding values of an index which
compares the prices paid by different types of household
for the commodities constituting the average household
diet in 1959.
