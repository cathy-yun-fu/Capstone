To Mr. Macmillan, Mr Gaitskell said the
Prime Minister should begin to take
seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
weapons within the Nato alliance. &quot;Let us say
to Macmillan that he should press, I hope
with the agreement of Kennedy, in
talks with the Soviet Union, for the establishment
in central Europe of a zone of controlled
disarmament.&quot;
