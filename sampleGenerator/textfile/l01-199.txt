on to say with a touch of self-importance: "No
wonder he tried to have me suffocated back
last summer. Must have thought I'd
rumbled him right from the start." By this
time Nick was certain in his own mind
that he had really seen Caxton's hand
snatching at the prop holding the barge's
hatch open, though he could never prove it,
and it would not be of much use if
he could.
