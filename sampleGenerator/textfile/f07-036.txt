When Nero supped in # his Golden House,
a mingled shower of flowers and odorous
essences fell upon him; and one of the
recreations of Heliogabalus was to
smother his courtiers with flowers. Nor was
it entirely as an object of luxury that the
ancients made use of flowers; they were
considered to possess sanative and
medicinal qualities.
