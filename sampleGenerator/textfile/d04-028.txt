&quot;For the stone shall cry out of the wall&quot;, like
Baalam's ass, &quot;and the purlin of timber shall
creak in answer&quot; &quot;if the roof of our security is
crushing our soul&quot; (see Hab. 2, 10-11). And it is
through the Shamir: &quot;That the earth shall be
filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; (Hab. 2, 14.)
