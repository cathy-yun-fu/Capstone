Ben Zoma said: "The days of 1thy life
means in the day-time; all the days of
1thy life means even at night-time."
(Berochoth.) And the Rabbis thought
it important that when we read the
Shmah "to be willing to hear," we
should remember the Great
Deliverance: Passover and its connection
with the fringes (the tsitsits).
