Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
minimum but the accuracy and precision of
weighing the precipitated sources suffers. All
precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
weights from the National Physical Laboratory.
Complete chemical exchange between the
radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
necessary if the analytical results are to
be correct.
