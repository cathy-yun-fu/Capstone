The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
a sanctuary, and only some rare birds know
the existence of it. These birds are, the Cherubim
and the Seraphim. We are also told that the Shamir
is the stylus used by Moses, and this stylus is described
as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant.
