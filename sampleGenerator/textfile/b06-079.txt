It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
ment to unite the movement as the Labour
leaders are not only in favour of American
bases, but are in favour of German bases and
troops being trained on British soil. The new
Defence statement, while accepting that Britain can-
not remain an independent nuclear Power, now
supports the policy of depending on American
nuclear weapons and the H-bomb, placing
Britain in an even more dangerous position.
