As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence, though
we found it an advantage in certain instances. Appendix

Department of Health for Scotland, the Home Office and
the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us;
officers of these Departments attended our meetings
and have given us valuable assistance.
