Some grim comic relief was provided by
an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
who hid himself in a bush and imitated
a blackbird. Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
was after this very bird and shot the farm-
labourer in the face. All, however,
ended well, reported the paper, since the
pellets were easily removed and the
labourer was able to return to work the
same afternoon.
