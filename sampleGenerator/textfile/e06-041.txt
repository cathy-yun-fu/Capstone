The Bow-wave Theory. This assumes
that all fishing gear, when moving,
sends before it a kind of scaring effect,
probably through waves or vibrations in
the water or along the ground.
Underwater films suggest that the
footrope of a trawl does this. Films
have also shown plaice moving before
a seine net in just the same way after
being gathered inwards by the ropes.
