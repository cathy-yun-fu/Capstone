Every garden boy will agree that having to
wash clay pots is a definite factor in
favour of their abolition; in fact one
young man was so wholehearted about this
a few years ago that he made the headlines
for having smashed a large number # to
relieve his feelings. On the small-to-medium
establishment, it is a disagreeable chore
which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm,
whereas on larger establishments the pots
can be sterilized or washed by machine.
