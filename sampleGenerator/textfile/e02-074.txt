But why woodwork in particular? Well, there
are many reasons. Wood is in good and
common supply; it lends itself to making
innumerable useful household items -
furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;
it enables results to be obtained fairly
quickly; it is less expensive than most
other materials; it is a pleasant material
to work with; and, although it does
create a certain amount of mess, it is
all clean and easily cleared away.
