The air passages were packed with corrugated
foil bonded to the primary plates to
provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer.
The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil,
chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy
dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
weight reductions as compared with copper construction.
