A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
water in the white areas of South Africa, without rights
and without hope. THE same sort of good neighbour
that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
Hitler in the thirties. It was Dr. Verwoerd who
led a protest against admitting any of them
because they would &quot;defile&quot; the national
white stock.
