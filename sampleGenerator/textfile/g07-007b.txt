In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and
Shelley, Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher
and Tita and the steward, Lega Zambelli, failed to perform
the most elementary duties towards the dead. He pretends
to have found everything in uttermost disorder - 'tokens that
the Pilgrim had most treasured, scattered on the floor, -
as rubbish of no marketable value, and trampled on'.
