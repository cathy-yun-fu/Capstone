JOHN DICKIE writes: Mr. Macmillan gave top
priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
return from Scotland yesterday. He summoned Mr.
Iain Macleod, Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Duncan Sandys,
Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
at Admiralty House. A statement is expected today
to hold the door open for modifications to the
new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
in Northern Rhodesia.
