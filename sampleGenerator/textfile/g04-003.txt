Dr. Davidson said he would go for
a walk over the fields while we attended
to our business. To my amusement,
when we met at tea at the rectory
after the Dedication, the Archbishop
said he had been stopped by
a farmer in a field. He seemed
rather indignant, but we took the
episode without a smile till afterwards.
