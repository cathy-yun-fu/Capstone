Catherine lives in a white house
overlooking the sweeping brown tides
of the river. She helped me clean up my
flat with a devotion which said that
she felt small flats were altogether more
romantic than large houses. We drank
tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,
being 15, has pure stern tastes in every-
thing from food to music.
