&quot;Of course you must count about two hundred
for legal charges and stamp duties,
maybe less, depending on the price of the
house, and whether it has been regis-
tered. I take it you have a mortgage lined
up, then, Mrs. - er - Buttery?&quot; &quot;Not yet,
but the bank would give me a loan, I'm
sure.&quot; &quot;Er, yes. You have some securities,
then?&quot;
