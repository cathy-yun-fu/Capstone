Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties
had refused to attend the talks because Sir Roy
had found messages sent from the Government were
&quot;unsatisfactory.&quot; African delegates to the talks yesterday
called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his negotiations with
Sir Roy's representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was
at Chequers last week-end. They said they regarded
with &quot;growing anger&quot; the gross and unconstitutional&quot;
interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in the talks.
