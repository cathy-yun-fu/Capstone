78. Regression estimates of the expenditure on
different commodities attributable to the adult
couple and each additional child in a selected
group of households consisting of childless couples
(both under 55) and couples with different numbers
of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
the Annual Report for 1956. The younger childless
couples are broadly comparable in age and family
income with the family households, so that differences
in food expenditure may be associated with the
presence of children.
