It is most unfair to call &quot;Malachias&quot; a cut-rate
&quot;Dolce Vita,&quot; for it is far more intimate and deeply
felt. In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
in &quot;Titanic&quot; by paralleling the last days of the
Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner,
and paid for his audacity with his life.
