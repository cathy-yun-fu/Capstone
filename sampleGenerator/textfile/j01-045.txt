Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated
with niobium separated from the coolant by a
solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from
the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
conditions for niobium and positive voltage, non-
oxidizing conditions. The practical application of
the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
tion before it can be realised.
