The blow took the writhing thug a fraction
above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical
plexus, the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago
Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed
combat targets. The thug collapsed with a whistling
moan, and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's
suddenly limp hand. There was no time for
rejoicing, but the hard, firm shape of the
automatic sent a new confidence surging through
his body.
