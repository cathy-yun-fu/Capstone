The plain, sober manner of its
style all the more tellingly
points up not only the horror
of the case itself, which
floundered on to the electrocution
four years later of a German-
born Bronx carpenter named
Bruno Richard Hauptmann, but
to the raree-show emotionalism
and sensation-hunger of that
era.
