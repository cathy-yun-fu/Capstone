Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish
love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a
futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the
first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.
She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.
Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had
come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits
with a weight of misgiving.
