We gathered together a splendid Sunday
afternoon service at the church, each child
being given a number which, as they came into
church, they could just whisper to
the superintendent who filled in the regi-
ster at her own home. Each child had a
picture given them and the lesson was
largely based on this. It was on a
stamp which could be stuck in
their book, and there was quite a
clamour for back stamps if a child
had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
