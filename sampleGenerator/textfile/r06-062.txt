There is a curd of morning smoke and
a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we
stopped, as in fine weather we always
stopped. Down below is the village of
Cagnes, but between are pockets of
heat and cold like the hands of
friends or strangers, and a flurry of
early smells, the dark bosoms of
beech and the thin pine fingers
kissed by the sun.
