The country, and his mistresses, have come
to mean too much to him. And, indirectly,
this impression I had of him was one of several
reasons why I had decided I should leave
it - before, for me too, it would be too late.
I used the excuse of our early start in the
morning to retire as soon as it seemed
prudent to do so, after the coffee and brandy,
already anticipating the familiar pleasures
awaiting me.
