Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
up. These &quot;fighters&quot; are in fact fighter bombers
which could launch an atomic attack on
Eastern Europe. By 1963 the Germans plan to have
nine missile battalions, with 288 missiles and
36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador
(range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.
