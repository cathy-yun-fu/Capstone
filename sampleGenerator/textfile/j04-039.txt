In the preliminary experiments, the tracer was added to a
liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with
strontium sulphate from hot solution. Chemical exchange
was complete under these conditions; but when the tracer
was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
stand for several days before the addition of lead
carrier, the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five
per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery
of the carrier.
