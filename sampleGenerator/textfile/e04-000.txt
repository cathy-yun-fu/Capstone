HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
family man or father-to-be. Unlike many
commercial articles, this chair is solidly built and
capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
most destructive youngster. Almost any available
timber can be used but Parana pine is
recommended, being cheap, easy to work, and
taking a good finish.
