In his first Hollywood picture, &quot;Let's Make Love,&quot; he
was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe
and Yves Montand. Against this couple Frankie, in
a cardboard role, didn't stand a chance. Now comes
&quot;The Right Approach&quot; (Rialto, &quot;A&quot;), and it's a glum
business. He plays an aspiring actor - a
selfish, arrogant, brash, ambitious, unscrupulous heel -
who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
the Hollywood ratrace.
