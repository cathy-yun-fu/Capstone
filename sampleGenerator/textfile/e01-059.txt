In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
hand-crocheted blouses, gossamer fine in
texture, are sold at a very high price. With a
little time and concentration the woman at home can
produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
Paris - a blouse, delicate gloves or a fine
edging for collar, cuffs or a handkerchief.
