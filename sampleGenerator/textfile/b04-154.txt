GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky! The tough,
resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
shakes the life out of his critics. He calls them

against African fanatics and woolly minded
individuals in the West. Some may ask: Is
Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
disagree with him? The facts answer that.
