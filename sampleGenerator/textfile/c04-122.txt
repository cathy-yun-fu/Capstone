&quot;Let's have another song with a month in it,&quot; said Tolch. Mr.
Charles obliged with &quot;April Serenade.&quot; This week it appears, a
tuneful melody sung impeccably by Robert Earl (Philips). PRODUCER
Russell Turner, 33, provides his last programme for the B B C tonight

with the Corporation, during which he started &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; and
directed &quot;Six-Five Special,&quot; Turner is aiming to go into free-lance
T V, film and stage production work.
