The train drew into another station
and Cecil, with a further six stops
to go, was left almost alone in the
coach. He fumed as he recol-
lected the long correspondence he
had had with the Inland Reve-
nue in an effort to obtain
tax relief for a jacket used
solely in the office. 'If the jacket
is a condition of your employment,'
the Inspector had written, 'it may
qualify for relief.'
