PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
over West Germany's cash offer to help
America's balance of payments position.
He said bluntly in Washington yester-
day that the offer - 357million - was
not good enough. And he indicated
that his Government would try to get
Germany to pay more. He did not
mention personal talks with Dr.
Adenauer, the West German Chancellor.
