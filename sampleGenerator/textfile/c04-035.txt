Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
the river. The film starts off brightly enough but,
half-way through, the plot (as well as the boat) springs
a near-disastrous leak. Familiar members of Britain's
repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.
