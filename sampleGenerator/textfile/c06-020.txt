That's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls-
Royce a type of transport. She's the
flower in a cultural desert. &quot;Now, me - I'm
a journalist, I write to entertain rather
than educate. And I don't write at all
unless I'm exceedingly 2skint. &quot;But I'll
say this. I'd like to live in America
and do some writing there.
