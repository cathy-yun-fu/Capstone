This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
a permanently water proof glue line. Be sure to

This may be bought at any good timber merchants.
The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
wood of the same make, or oak or mahogany. For the
last one I made, I used the two flaps from an old
mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
shilling.
