Yesterday West German Defence Minister,
Herr Strauss, started talks with the British
Defence Minister, Mr. Watkinson. Their talks
are another stage in the cloak operation,
1961 variety, by which the West German
militarists are advancing their rearmament.
Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
that his policy was to make his country
the &quot;strongest militarily in Europe and the
United States' principal Nato ally.&quot;
