Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
ately refrained during the summer from
recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
by proclamation, such as would be
necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
on to a fully active footing. That
would have created a thoroughly unde-
sirable atmosphere of panic. He thought
that the situation was rather more
hopeful.
