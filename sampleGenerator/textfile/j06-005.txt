The migrating stages all come from 100-250
meters, and the time of their arrival at
the surface is directly related to their
swimming capacity: 3rd (oldest)
calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr; 2nd,
from 2200-0200 hr; and 1st, from 0200-0600 hr.
Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
at the surface while the young migrate
to and from a depth of 50 meters.
