Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch
given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
guests present, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
times yesterday. In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of
State, gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
15-nation Nato council. Some of his listeners said he was
&quot;rather pessimistic&quot; and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.
