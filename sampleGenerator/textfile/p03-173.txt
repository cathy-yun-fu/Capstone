Almost in desperation she appealed, &quot;Will you meet
me at the gate, four o'clock tomorrow?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; he
enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair. &quot;To bring
me up for tea, of course. I just thought.&quot; &quot;I'll see,&quot;
he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
which really hurt. &quot;Without your ring it's just like
kissing somebody else's girl,&quot; he decided wickedly,
and kissed her again, somewhat startled to
receive a sharp slap for his pains.
