It would now seem that Wicki's name must
be added to this list, for his new film
may well be a landmark in the revitali-
sation of the German cinema. Wicki is
not only a director. He began his career
as an actor, had his first important
film ro*?5le in Ka&quot;utner's &quot;Die letzt
Bru&quot;cke,&quot; and he also appears in the
new Antonioni film.
