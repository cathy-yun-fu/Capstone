During this period, when large numbers of school-
leavers will be looking for jobs, there will be
relatively few retirements. For the most part therefore
local employment can be provided only by the
expansion of existing industry and the introduction
of new factories, laboratories and offices, and
the expected but not easily stimulated development
of the service industries. Schemes for training
young people in industry and commerce will
be particularly important in the new towns.
