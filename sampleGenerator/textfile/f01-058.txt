Thus learning how to learn means becoming
your own philosopher, your own psychologist
and your own teacher. You will then be
a well-established learner and the world
will be at your feet. Although the word
&quot;mind&quot; has given rise to endless
controversy among philosophers and psycho-
logists, many of whom would like to
abolish it from the dictionary, most
of us obstinately go on using it.
