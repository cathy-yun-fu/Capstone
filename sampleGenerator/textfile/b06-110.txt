But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
prefer unskilled jobs. Countless numbers who want training
are denied it. One area electricity board in 1958
offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
applications, of whom 100 were considered suitable by
the board. There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth
dockyard last year.
