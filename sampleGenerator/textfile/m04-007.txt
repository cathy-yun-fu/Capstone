And a fine old fuss there was about it, too.
Here are the known facts. On 10th July,
the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl,
left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual.
Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan
Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader;
pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball
and Miss Ethel Yates, hikers from
Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the
Rev. Edwards.
