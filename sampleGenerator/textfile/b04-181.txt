There is no doubt what the Danes understand
by free trade. It is that they should be free
to sell as much as they like, while buying
more and more from our rivals. Germany has
now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
principal supplier. The farmers of Britain
understand free trade. That is why they fight
it.
