This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the
aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's,
the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
became established for aero-engine radiators, using
dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages
were separated by flat plates.
