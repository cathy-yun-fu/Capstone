With something of a start I remembered the
man who'd brought us into this business.
&quot;Maybe you don't know about Appleton,
Dan?&quot; &quot;Know what?&quot; &quot;That he's dead,&quot;
I said. I watched him because I was always
fascinated by the way he looked when you
tried to surprise him. &quot;Dead?&quot; he said. &quot;Yes.
Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted
down with a shotgun outside the Palace
last night.&quot;
