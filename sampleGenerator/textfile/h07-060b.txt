The development corporations have provided office
accommodation (in addition to that included in
factory premises) in the form of buildings specially
designed to meet the needs of particular organisations,
and have also erected some buildings as a
speculative venture. Despite some misgivings, these
have readily let on satisfactory terms, including
in many cases a break clause in the lease allowing
for a future increase in rent to reflect rising
values in the town.
