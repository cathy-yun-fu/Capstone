Where the 2bhoys are. In the hallway are
the empties; through the door hearts are
full, hopes are high. There are still a few
amber inches in the bottle. Present are some
hard-core Friends of Brendan. They listen
with many an obliging guffaw to the
brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal
roller-coaster, with occasional stops for an old
I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker.
