We have held eleven meetings. We decided as a
first step to seek information from a number
of organisations and persons having an interest
in the questions before us and at a later stage we
arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
anybody interested to submit representations. We
compiled a list of the points which we thought
were of importance, but we made it clear that
the replies need not be confined to these
particular items.
