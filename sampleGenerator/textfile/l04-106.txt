In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
Dowell drank their beer and waited. 'It's too damn busy
in here. We can't expect him to leave his customers',
Hugh said morosely. 'Give him a chance, old chap.
He'll be over. Jim's a most reliable chap when
it comes to picking up a small tip.'
