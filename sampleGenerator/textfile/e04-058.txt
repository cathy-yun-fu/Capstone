If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
the moulds, make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
Fig. 2. The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
rigid as possible, for it is on these you will be building
and shaping your little craft, upside-down. For cheapness
I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
Columbia.
