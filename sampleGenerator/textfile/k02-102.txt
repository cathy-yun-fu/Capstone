There was still an ease in our conversation, but its
scope was restricted. I felt that I could hardly make the
usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I
wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment.
And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few drinks,
then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
dinner.
