Earl Russell, President of the Committee
of 100, told Kennedy that he should
take notice of &quot;that very large and
growing section which is opposed to
the establishment of a Polaris base,
whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
British territory.&quot; He pointed out that
already there have been protests but
that &quot;very much larger protests are to
be expected and are being planned.&quot;
