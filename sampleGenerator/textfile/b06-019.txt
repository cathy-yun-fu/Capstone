The process has been too slow for Herr
Strauss and last month he attacked
Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's
plans for a &quot;unified supply apparatus&quot;
in Nato. (A supply apparatus which would
link together the various West German
&quot;facilities.&quot;) By the end of the year there
will be 11 German divisions in Nato
compared with four divisions of
British troops.
