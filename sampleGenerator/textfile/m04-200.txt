LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the
Dinas Advertiser. But the London papers ignored
the whole affair. Ifor Evans reported his loss
to the police. But they only tut-tutted. &quot;Lost
a bus, is it. Very careless.&quot; That was their
attitude. Now if there'd been a good old accident,
they could have measured up the road and
taken an interest.
