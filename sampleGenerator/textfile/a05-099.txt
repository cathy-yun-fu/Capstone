A reference to the reunification of Germany
brought a bark of &quot;Start another war!&quot;
from Mr. Ellis Smith (Lab., Stoke on Trent S.).
Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
theme of limitation of armaments in Europe.
This could, he suggested, be linked with
prohibition of the production of atomic
weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection
and control would be much easier to
establish in these territories.
