This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000
worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious. The play
had style, moved at a quick pace and everyone did
well. But it was Mr. Houston's evening.
Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley
Holloway's act too long and not particularly
entertaining. It was also a mistake to
re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
so soon after their previous appearance.
