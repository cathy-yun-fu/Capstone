Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
picture of this &quot;basis&quot; of mental phenomena?
The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,
with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed
picture of the basis of such material phenomena
as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of
gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its
theories of &quot;mind&quot;? Are there any ultimate units
of mind akin to the atoms of matter?
