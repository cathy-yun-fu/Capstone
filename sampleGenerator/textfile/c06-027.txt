It's a very free place to write in, and there's
the advantage that no one knows what
you're writing about anyway. &quot;Not that I did
much when I was over this past two times,
not with that great little Irish bar on
Seventh Avenue, The Pigsty, always open.
I was there, in even faster orbit, when that
third astronaut went up - what's his name?
