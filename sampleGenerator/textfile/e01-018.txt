We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the
reign of Charles 2 stating: 'Lost: a lawn 1hand-
kercher with a broad hem laced round with
fine Point lace about four fingers broad' and
among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
unpaid bill for 'scarlet satin shoes with
silver lace'. The records of these tender trifles
are very touching but then lace does place
upon everything a delicate sentiment.
