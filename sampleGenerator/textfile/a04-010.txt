An attempt to get more information about the
Admiralty House meeting will be made in the
House of Commons this afternoon. Labour M.P.s already
have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
for a statement. President Kennedy flew from London
Airport last night to arrive in Washington this
morning. He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide
broadcast and television report on his
talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening.
