My chance had come at last. I had to
take it. I was going to smash him as
he had twice tried to smash me. (His
eyes, wild and frightened, were fixed on
Tong. Tong guessed that they did not
see him.) I told Starmouth to go at
once and report exactly what he had
seen to Dackson and his daughter.
He did as he was told.
