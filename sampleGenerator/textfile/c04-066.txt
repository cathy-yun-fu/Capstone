HOW do you get on records? Well, you've got
to have something different. Sing slightly flat.
All the good singers sing in tune. Twang a guitar
slightly off key. Everybody's fed up with the
right way - so the best-seller charts say. Play
an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one. You got to
get it into your head, son... people
don't like things as they should be - not on
record, anyway.
