In this region of Monti most of the public baths
had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the
breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
the baths had lost their purpose; they had become
stone quarries and their precious marble had been
burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits
used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger
of travellers in the district.
