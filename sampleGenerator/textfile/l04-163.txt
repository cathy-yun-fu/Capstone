Stealing from cars is about the commonest
kind of crime in the book. There's nothing
that absolutely ties the missing money to the
circumstances of your father's death, that's
the point. Same with the passport. It's gone
and that's that. It may turn up in a dustbin
somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As
far as the police are concerned there's nothing
to go on.
