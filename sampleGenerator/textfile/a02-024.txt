Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
first to be held in Africa. Only a few hours af-
ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
at Accra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants
demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
Stores, the largest in town.
