The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
week. Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget,
including a compulsory savings scheme which the
Ghana Government introduced in July. Ghana's strong
man is not here to face the storm. President Nkrumah,
having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
in Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black
Sea and no one here professes to know when he
will return.
