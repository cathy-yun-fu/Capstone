VERDICT: The &quot;bunk&quot; needed doubling.
DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's
&quot;Drama '61&quot; last night as a smooth,
scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques
Gillies, &quot;The Takers.&quot; A polished production
by Quentin Lawrence, here, held together
by Mr. Houston's accomplished
performance as the master mind behind a
gang of crooks.
