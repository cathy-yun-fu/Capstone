It was the end of a rather curious
speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
the two-day debate on foreign affairs.
He began in a low, almost chatty mono-
tone, and his voice never rose to any
accent of urgency. He passed in rapid
review the United Nations Secretariat;
nuclear tests; the canard about British
interference with the United Nations
in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East
Asia.
