Provided the temperatures at C and E are
the same, thermoelectric contributions to the
voltage should be zero. The probe extends
out of the sodium stream through a close
fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes
into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G.
The open end of the probe is sealed with
a vacuum coupling H which also positions
the +ve nickel conductor with respect
to the sodium by circlips on either side
of the seal I.
