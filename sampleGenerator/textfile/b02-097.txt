To be able to say &quot;New York next week&quot; is an
important advance. We must not be overconfident
that this # meeting will lead on to further
and decisive ones; but without it, we could not
look for them. Federal Germany votes tomorrow
and not a day too soon. There can seldom have
been an election campaign which more people
in and out of the country wanted to see over
and done with.
