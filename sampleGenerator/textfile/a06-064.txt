Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had, if
anything, rallied support to the Prime Minister.
This apparently, was Mr. Macmillan's assessment.
He confined his reply to the observation
that Mr. Fell had probably &quot;maximised his
support.&quot; There were no other attacks
of such ferocity. But there was ample
evidence of Conservative and Labour
opposition, which will be aired in the
debate tomorrow and on Thursday.
