Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in
construction, cheapness and lightness of weight,
and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
and an outboard motor with a comfortable
margin of freeboard.
