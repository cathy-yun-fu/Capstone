Senator Allen Ellender of Louisiana sparked
off the opposition by telling a television
audience it was &quot;current Washington gossip&quot;
that Weaver once had Communist affiliations.
The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed
by another Southern Senator - Willis Robertson,
of Virginia - met today in closed session
to discuss Weaver's appointment. Senator
Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter
to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
complaints about Weaver's loyalty.
