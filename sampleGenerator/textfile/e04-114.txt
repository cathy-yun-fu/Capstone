Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom,
which is cut in one piece. It should overlap just a
trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are
screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
the screws. I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
the bottom, both for screwing to the chines and
the bottom shaped transom facing.
