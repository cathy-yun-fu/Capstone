The film replaced &quot;What's My Line?&quot; and &quot;Be My
Guest&quot; programmes because of an electricians'
strike. It showed Britain today through the eyes
of an American T V reporter, Eric Sevareid, and
British personalities. Among them - Professor
Dennis Brogan, Shelagh Delaney, and Alan Sillitoe.
The film covered a wide aspect of the British
scene, ranging from pubs, the Eton wall game,
to the European Common Market.
