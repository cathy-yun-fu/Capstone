It would become easy to become cynical and
to despair. And yet, wherever the issues were put
clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their
original stand. Only where the issues were
posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
were positions lost. It is my view that this
immediate confusion hides the fact that the
Peace movement is still advancing and that
clarification of the issues can bring a
majority to # secure the Scarborough
decisions.
