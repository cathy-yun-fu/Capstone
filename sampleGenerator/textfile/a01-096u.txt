The Press, many doctors and public were
denouncing the proposals. He quoted from
this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received:
&quot;My background is a doctor of 68, who
has practised medicine for 43 years, chiefly
as a panel doctor. &quot;I am a lifelong
Conservative. I am horrified and amazed
by my party's proposal to prostitute the
whole principle of the State service and
to render that service a hardship to poor
people.
