The urge came from a conference of activists of
Nkrumah's Convention Party &quot;after powerful addresses
by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio,&quot; and
others. Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi
a &quot;limited state of emergency&quot; was declared, giving
the Government adequate power to maintain all
essential services and ensure food supplies. Thus it
becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
for anyone who &quot;publishes a report likely to cause
alarm or prejudicial to public safety.&quot;
