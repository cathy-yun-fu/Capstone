This development coincided with the introduction of
pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer
coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
were of comparable magnitude, the use of
secondary surface was still attractive, since the
greater part of the surface area could be made up
of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.
