All stages of Calanus, for example,
seem to migrate on some occasions while
any stage may not on others. Such data
cannot yet be rationalized. Where
information is less extensive, however, it is
possible to find some regularity in the
observations. Thus in Euphausia superba
from the Antarctic, the metanauplii remain
in deep water, the later larval stages
migrate diurnally, and the adolescents
stay permanently at the surface.
