Most of those who expound a theory of textual
dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
written entirely by one author before the
disturbance took place but a few leave it open
to suppose that the original book had been
revised even before the upheaval. The ingenuity
of the theories is impressive and is the best
argument against them.
