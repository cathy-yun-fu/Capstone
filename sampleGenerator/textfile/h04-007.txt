Compared with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959
showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
children and those with one child, and much smaller
changes for couples with several children. The quantity
index, which has risen only slowly since 1956, was
almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
children, but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult
households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
couples and couples with one child.
