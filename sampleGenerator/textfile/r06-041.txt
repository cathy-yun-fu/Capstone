There was a front-page rear-attack on de
Gaulle, and the rest of the paper was given up
to murders, apart for an outcry against a
proposal to drop radio-active material into
the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
Raphael. All the murders were well documented
and had the air of being written by an
ingenious, but mad film director of the
Thirties.
