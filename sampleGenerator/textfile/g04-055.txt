We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
the Brighton Road, in a street full of small houses.
This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
there, but was soon changed into the better-
sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There
were lots of children there, and we had
a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
service. I soon saw that the parish needed
more help both at the church and Mission
district.
