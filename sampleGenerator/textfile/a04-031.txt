RELAXED, smiling and clearly in the best of
spirits, Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to
Moscow after his two days of talks with President
Kennedy, writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow. The
good beginning made at Vienna must be
followed up by new efforts for peace, the
Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
declared yesterday. Events in Vienna &quot;gave hope
to people of goodwill who hate the cold war,
and to all who are striving for a stable peace,&quot;
