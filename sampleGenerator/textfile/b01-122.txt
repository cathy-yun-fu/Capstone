It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
woerd in his nightmare world. It is this that
makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-

Capetown, Dr. Joost de Blank, has pleaded that
South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
Commonwealth. Otherwise, he says, those inside the
country who still oppose apartheid will be
left even more isolated and alone.
