&quot;Now, to summarize what I think our
course of action should be. First, to avoid the
Thetans like the plague, for they must not
find us out! Second, to tread pretty warily
among our own people, finding out just how
much freedom we can take with safety.
And third, to study these damned Thetans.
We must learn all we can about
them.
