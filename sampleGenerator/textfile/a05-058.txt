&quot;We must not be rattled into surrender,
but we must not - and I am not - be
afraid of negotiation.&quot; Mr. Godber,
Minister of State, Foreign Office, said
earlier that the Government had asked
the Medical Research Council to reassess
the fall-out position in view of the Russian
tests. The Council's findings would be
made public.
