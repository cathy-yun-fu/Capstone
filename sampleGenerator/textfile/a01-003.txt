Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a
large majority of Labour M Ps are likely to
turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution. Mr.
Foot's line will be that as Labour M Ps
opposed the Government Bill which brought
life peers into existence, they should not
now put forward nominees. He believes
that the House of Lords should be abolished
and that Labour should not take any steps
which would appear to &quot;prop up&quot; an out-dated
institution.
