The Archbishop has long been a courageous
fighter against apartheid. He must be heard
with attention. On purely practical grounds he
holds that it would be a mistake to expel
South Africa, weakening the whites who are
working for a change of policy. In his view
it would also be against the interests of the
Africans.
