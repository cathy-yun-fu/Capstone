The defeat of the leader of the
Progressive party, Dr. Steytler, in Port
Elizabeth South, announced immediately
afterwards by the United party candidate,
Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives deprived
of both their chief figures. Dr. Verwoerd and
the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de
Villiers Graaff, have been returned unopposed.
The contests were for 86 seats as 70
Nationalists and 20 United party candi-
dates are unopposed.
