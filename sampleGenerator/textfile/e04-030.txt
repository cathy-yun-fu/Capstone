To complete the job, screw two fittings to the
inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
back to hold the baby's safety harness. These can be
made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
wire as shown in Fig. 6. Make sure that these
are well secured as they will have to withstand
considerable pulling as the child becomes older.
