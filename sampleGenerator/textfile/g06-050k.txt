Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
master at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking
for advice. In doing so he described his
distinguished patient and his symptoms. He
told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a
strong, energetic man with a gentle and
charming character, even-tempered and sedate,
not easily irritated, patient and persevering,
'but he appears to despair of ever being cured.'
