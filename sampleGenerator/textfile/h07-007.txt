There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
Crawley. The development corporations have aimed at a varied
pattern of industry, offering a reasonable choice of
employer as well as choice of occupation for men, women and
school-leavers, with due regard to the industries
already established in their towns. Inevitably engineering,
including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
predominates in all the London new towns since these are
among the industries which have expanded most
during the last ten years in the country generally.
