Present-day pots are better finished, do
not get dirty so readily and are easier to
wash. The deep rims make for neater and
safer stacking, though they are still
expensive and still get broken. On the
other hand, there is really no replacement
for the larger sizes, so they have the
decided advantage of being the only
suitable container available in quantity
for fairly large plants.
