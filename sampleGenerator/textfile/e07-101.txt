One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved
completely. Manufacturing the block and planting
it is very little more trouble than normal potting,
and a superior plant, which transplants more
easily, is produced. The obvious limitation #
is that soil blocks can only be used for
propagating; there can be no progression to a
larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
to be moved; it must be planted out or
potted.
