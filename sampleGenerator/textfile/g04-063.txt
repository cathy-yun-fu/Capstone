A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
year, 1914, when war broke out. Very soon Chaplains for
the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly
that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did
not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish
for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed
than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and
was very soon in France where he did splendid
work until his health broke down and he had a bad
attack of enteric fever.
