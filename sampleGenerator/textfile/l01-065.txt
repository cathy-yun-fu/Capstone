Carol Carstairs, interviewed by
Passon and Tong for the second time,
began by agreeing that she could
have been mistaken about the
precise minute of Dackson's visit
the previous Wednesday, and ended
by admitting that he was in fact
at least half an hour late for
his appointment with her. &quot;There
it is,&quot; Passon commented
afterwards. &quot;She is a business
woman.
