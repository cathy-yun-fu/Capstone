But there is heart in the telling, and an intense
realism in the situation. A young girl lives in
a single dingy room with her slatternly,
promiscuous mother. In such surroundings she
learns sex is something sordid, and when she
experiences it for the first time herself it
is incoherently, clumsily, but half shyly and
half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny her
first lover is a sailor who leaves her to bear
his child and sails away.
