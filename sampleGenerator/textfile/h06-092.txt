A new method of applying sand to the
faces of green bricks has recently been
developed. In the case of wire-cut bricks
the column of clay from the pug-mill is
carried by a short length of belt
conveyor to the sanding plant.
This consists basically of a vibrating
hopper from which the sand is
distributed to all four faces by a
system of slots, scrapers and worms.
