It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
ended yesterday in 32 members of the
Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
a breach of the peace. The committee's
president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
a week. Playwrights Arnold Wesker (The Kitchen)
and Robert Bolt (The Flowering Cherry) were
jailed for a month.
