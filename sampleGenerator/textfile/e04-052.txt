For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails
in place of screws. We just bend them over and clamp
firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I've
always used brass screws, which are more expensive. The first
job is to make your moulds. In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply,
but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this
is nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked
and cut to shape later.
