If there is sufficient beta activity, the radioche-
mical purity of the Bi-210 may be checked
by observing the decay curve. The removal of lead
chromate from the aluminium counting tray together
with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion
exchange separation has been checked by
counting the trays. Not more than 0.2 of the
bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
acid wash.
