At the present time in most of the towns the waiting
period has tended to grow, partly because
the # buoyancy of industry generates increasing
demands, partly because in recent years the pressure
on the building industry, the shortage of bricks
and other materials, and the shortage of
skilled labour, especially in the finishing trades,
has made it difficult for corporations to achieve
their full programme.
