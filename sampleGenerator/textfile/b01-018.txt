THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society. A
policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
is surely the one thing that it could not survive.
Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
London, millions at home would regard as fraudulent
a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
South Africa. And this is a Commonwealth in
which five citizens are coloured for every one
who is white.
