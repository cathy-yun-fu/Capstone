Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
to the Commonwealth through the
strength we would gain in the Common
Market than by isolation. He paid
tribute to the development of the
Common Market. &quot;The Community
(Common Market) has imparted an
impetus and an economic growth
to The Six. Above all, it is an idea
which has gripped men's minds,&quot;
he said.
