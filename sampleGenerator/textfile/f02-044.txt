In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director
of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready
to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. An
approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
tober, 1959, the first experimental day-release course for
men was organised. Eleven students from seven firms atten-
ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
to the men and their employers that the venture was an
experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
as the participants.
