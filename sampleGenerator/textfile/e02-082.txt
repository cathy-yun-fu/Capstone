This last point is certainly important because almost
everyone has come to recognise that machines
are not only an economic necessity, but that a
great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
installation of a power tool. As an elementary
example, surely no one can pretend to enjoy
ripping out parts from hardwood. Most men
would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
were available.
