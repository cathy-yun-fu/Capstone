The more delicate patterns and finer
threads may be reserved to bring a light
and lovely touch to personal possessions -
a lace border to a handkerchief, fine-lace
insertion on a petticoat or blouse, a tatted edge
to a collar; these add a charming, feminine
distinction that nothing else can give.
Although we assess lace-making as one of
the feminine skills, a number of the well-loved
traditional patterns that we follow today were,
in fact, the brain-children of inventive men.
