For this fairly small group, comparisons between different
years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
defined number of children. In 1959 the households in
this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64)
than in the previous year (average 4.53). Their total food
expenditure increased less than that in other groups,
and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish,
poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate
biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are more
expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
they purchased less, namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase
meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat products.
