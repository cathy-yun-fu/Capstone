Up and down the country husbands will be saying
they would never behave like that. But do they ever
ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
returned to the shed; their books tidied; and often,
even their shoes cleaned? How wonderful if they
showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers!
