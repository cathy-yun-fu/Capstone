Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Fede-
ration. Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end
meeting. But he told M Ps yesterday: &quot;I
have no knowledge of secret negotiations.&quot; He
said Britain had an obligation to consult
the Federal Government. Mr. James Callaghan,
Labour's Colonial spokesman, said Sir Roy had
no right to delay progress in the talks by
refusing to sit round the conference table.
