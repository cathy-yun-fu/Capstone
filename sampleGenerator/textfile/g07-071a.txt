There were few things in Augusta's whole
life, full of calamities though it was, that
hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
from George Anson Byron, whom she had
loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked
on as her intimate friend. Moreover, he
was without the right to make such
pronouncements: he had inherited nothing
from her brother but his title, whereas
she was not only of nearer consanguinity
but the chosen recipient of his property.
