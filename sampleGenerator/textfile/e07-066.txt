A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
Grantham, Lincs, kindly offered to
cooperate with me in studying praying
mantis as a pest control in the cold
greenhouse. Of the dozen Spanish mantis
sent him by post on June 22, only two or
three survived the journey; one thrived
and the latest report I have is that
this mantis is still alive.
