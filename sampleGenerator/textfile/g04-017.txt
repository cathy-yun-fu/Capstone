It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play. The place and its people were
to play an important part in my life. For five years in succession till
war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays there and became
very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between the
Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be
performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would
be discovered and trained.
