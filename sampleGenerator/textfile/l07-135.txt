Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
haggled with him and within half an hour
Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
fifty pounds. When all the business details
had been settled and the owner had
departed with my cheque in his pocket,
Clive started the engine and gave me my
first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
the river and in and out of the other boats.
