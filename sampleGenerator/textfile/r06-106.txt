The day I promised to take Catherine
down to visit my young friend Philip
at his school in the country, we were
to leave at eleven, but she arrived
at nine. Her blue dress was new,
and so were her fashionable shoes. Her
hair had just been done. She looked
more than ever like a pink and gold
Renoir girl who expects everything from
life.
