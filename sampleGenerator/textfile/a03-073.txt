On the specific question of the use of Blue
Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
easier. He can point out that this is the
only rocket and launcher in Europe to
have reached a sufficient stage of development
for adaptation as the first stage in
putting a heavy satellite into outer space.
There has also been some talk of adopting another
British rocket, Black Knight, for the second
stage, but the French have one of their
own called Veronique which they would
like to see used.
