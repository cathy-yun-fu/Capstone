I slept soundly, and much later than I should. It
was already after six when I awoke, and the sun
was nearly setting beyond the west window.
Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices,
and knew they were back. I wondered, as I
wrapped a 6sarong around my waist, if
Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
afternoon sleep.
