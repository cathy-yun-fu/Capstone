Rosenquist (4) showed that minute quantities of
lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu-
tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium
sulphate. Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
of the strontium sulphate is incomplete. Using
ten milligrams of lead carrier and six
hundred milligrams of strontium per liter,
more than 95 experiment.
