It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
at the moment &quot;an awful mess up&quot; in
the measurement of temperatures. This,
however, seems a matter of the convenience
of specialists. The ordinary British man
and woman is conscious of no difficulty.
Rather than fifty million people having
to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
any reason why the centigrade countries
should not change to fahrenheit?
