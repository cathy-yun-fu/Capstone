We parked the Lambretta opposite the
Negresco, and went to the beach to
have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked
in our eyes. The sea boiled with waves,
they galloped to the walls and spumed
over the Promenade des Anglais. A huge
crowd had collected. There were firemen
and policemen and ambulances, and the
eyes of the spectators were hard with
disaster.
