The action of the Shamir writes books and their
books are readable. This Shamir is indeed a rare
diamond that incises the hardest rock, the hardest
facts. And these creatures existed from the
beginning. It is &quot;the stone, which the builders
refused, but it is to become the head-stone
of the corner&quot;. (Ps. 118, 22.) And the stone shall
tell!
