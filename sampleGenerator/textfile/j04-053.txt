A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle. The
sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
convert the resin completely to the chloride form.
The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
remove the acid and finally dried in air.
