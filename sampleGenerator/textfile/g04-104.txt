In those early years 1914-18, life was very full
both in the parish and in the wider war activities.
The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in
Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards
at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.
I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them
frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with
the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
someone who knew their native villages.
