Except at Hemel Hempstead, large office
organisations have until quite recently shown
little interest in the new towns, probably because of
the difficulty in the early years in recruiting
suitable staff, especially junior staff, locally.
There is evidence of greater interest today,
with nearly half a million square feet of
office space under construction - almost as
much as the total area so far completed.
