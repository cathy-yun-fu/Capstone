The average gross return on established industrial estates
ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land,
site works and buildings. Manufacturing industry affords
employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
manual workers. An analysis made by Crawley Development
Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from fifty-eight
manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff,
showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as technical
or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.
