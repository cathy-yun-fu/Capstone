It is also important to remember that on
lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
from the line may take place without
actual contact. A new type of
machine has recently been developed for
the automatic rolling of sole leather
bends. The sheet of leather is placed
on a sliding feed tray outside the
danger zone and is then pushed
forward between two platens, the upper
one carrying a set of small rollers.
