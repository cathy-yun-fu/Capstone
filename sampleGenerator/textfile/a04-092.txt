There are three kinds of reasons that justify
the protests and these should carry weight with
the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. &quot;The
first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government
circles, but in public opinion.&quot; Earl Russell
says it is inevitable, though profoundly
regrettable, that the agitation against
the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
to the policy of the United States.
