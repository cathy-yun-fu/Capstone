LESS has been heard of Brendan's work. It is now
five years since his first play, The Quare Fellow, was
produced, three years since Borstal Boy was published
and The Hostage was put on. What has happened to
the play, Richard's Cork Leg, begun 18 months ago
and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal,
Stratford, last spring? It was never finished.
