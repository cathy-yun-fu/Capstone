The biological control of pests in the garden
is not new to the American gardener. Lady-
birds figure in press advertisements, their
sale being by the gallon. Praying mantis (Mantis
religiosa), both native and &quot;immigrant&quot; varieties,
are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
States. Advertisements offer eggs of European,
Chinese or native forms of mantis.
