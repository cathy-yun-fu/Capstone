We are glad to note the action that has been taken
and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
that, as other preparations affecting the central nervous
system become available, they too will be brought to
the notice of the Poisons Board, or such other advisory
body as may in due course be appointed for the
purpose, to consider whether there are sufficient
grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
on prescription.
