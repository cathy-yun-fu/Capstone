These figures are much higher than the national
averages, and may be thought to indicate a
lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other
hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
skilled employment and are highly diversified
as regards products, markets and methods of
manufacture. Consumer goods industries such as the
manufacture of food # and drink, tobacco, clothing
and footwear are under-represented in the new
towns generally though not in Basildon and
Welwyn.
