Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable. They
alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
through the gormless standing corn around them. Perhaps
it was accidental - I hope not. If ever a bag of
humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
farce is it when it comes to television.
