Yes, the bus set out from Dinas. So much
is established. Ifor Huw Evans, Propr.,
watched it go from the windows of the
Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested,
Ifor was. For there was his garage hand,
Dai Pugh, taking a tearful farewell of
Morfydd Owen. Morfydd, who had until
recently been Ifor's typist, but was now
returning to her home town as a
fully-fledged schoolteacher.
