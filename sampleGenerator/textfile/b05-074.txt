They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
was an iniquitous injustice. When they burst into
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Holland, Belgium and France
they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
them that they were being &quot;encircled.&quot; They really
believed in the moral superiority of &quot;The New
Order&quot; which Himmler on October 4, 1943, expressed
thus: &quot;Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves to # our Kultur; otherwise
it is of no interest to me.
