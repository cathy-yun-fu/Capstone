Mr. Anthony Fell (Yarmouth) called the decision &quot;shocking&quot;
and added: &quot;It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
Minister has done for many, many generations.&quot; He
concluded: &quot;The best service the Prime Minister can do
would be to resign.&quot; The outburst shocked MPs of
all parties. Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
to stop.
