When Nick returned home he found that his
mother was seriously ill. She had pneumonia. The
sight of her youngest son, the doctor said, was the
only thing that saved her; it gave her the strength
she needed to fight for life. Soon she was out of
danger, but the doctor told Dan that she would
have to remain in bed for some time and
that thereafter it was essential that she should
not have to exert herself.
