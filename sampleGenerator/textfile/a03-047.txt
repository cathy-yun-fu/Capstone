It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
in the role of a popular orator at the
hustings, the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
baker was in the last two campaigns. The
impression remains that the Liberal leader
is still the diplomatist, more at home
in the chancery, or the corridors of the United
Nations, not the father figure, so necessary
in Canadian leadership, or the practical
politician, able to talk about sewage problems
in Algoma East.
