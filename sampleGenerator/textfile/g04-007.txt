The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter
when the distance to the church deterred many from
coming to Sunday Evensong. We managed to furnish
a table with cross and candles, and the people
appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
as for more secular purposes. In 1910 Dr. Talbot
was translated to Winchester, and Dr. Hubert
Burge became Bishop of Southwark.
