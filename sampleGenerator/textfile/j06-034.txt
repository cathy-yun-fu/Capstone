2. Mechanisms. The majority of
vertical migrations undoubtedly
result from active swimming
although passive movement through
the water has been suggested on
various grounds. For example,
transport in vertical currents
resulting from temperature diff-
erences has been proposed; diff-
erences in water viscosity after
temperature changes have also been
