Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume
today. PRESIDENT KENNEDY today defended
the appointment of a Negro as his Housing Minister.
It has aroused strong opposition from the anti-Negro
senators of the Deep South. The negro is Mr.
Robert Weaver of New York. One of his tasks
will be to see there is no racial discrimination
in Government and State housing projects.
