MR. Macmillan has picked a strong &quot;brains trust&quot;
team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
And he has abandoned plans to visit President de

de Gaulle's official welcome last week
to Britain's moves towards the Six was
taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
but no more than that.
