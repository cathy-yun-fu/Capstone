The storage problem puts clay pots at a
definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy
and difficult things to accommodate and
they must have some protection from severe
weather, which can be quite a headache in
a small garden. While admitting that
broken pots have on occasions provided
artists with delightful studies, there is no
doubt that a pile of badly stacked,
half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
from any point of view.
