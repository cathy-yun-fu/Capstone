There is only one way to develop unity and
at the same time defend Britain. This
was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, representing 800,000 organised
trade unionists, when it decided by overwhelming
votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
on unilateral disarmament, and to oppose
Polaris and military bases being installed on
the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.
