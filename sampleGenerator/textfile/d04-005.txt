According to the legend, Solomon had asked the
Prince of the Demons, &quot;Ashmodeus&quot; to bring him
the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
Shamir had not been placed under his charge, as
there is no Shamir in Gehenna (Hell). An eagle
brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden,
the Paradise, the only place where the Shamir
could be found.
