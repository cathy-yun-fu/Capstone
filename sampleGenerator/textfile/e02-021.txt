Incidentally, it is better to
complete any mortising that may be
needed at the top before the tapering is
begun. Some plain tapered legs have
the taper on the two inner faces only,
the outer surfaces being vertical as
at (B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as
that at (D), Fig. 1, the square is first
marked out as at (A), Fig. 3.
