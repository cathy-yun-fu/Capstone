The other TUC demands: Five leading
Communists must not hold office for five
years; Sub-committees set up to strip
secretary John Byrne of his powers must
disband in ten days. These the ETU
executive rejected as &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot;
and &quot;unwarranted&quot; interference.&quot; But it
agreed to postpone operation of the sub-
committees.
