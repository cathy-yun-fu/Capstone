The following table indicates the size of the
firms, some of them occupying more than
one factory, introduced or sponsored by
development corporations in the new towns: The
overall average for the factories sponsored by
development corporations is about 170 employees
per firm, and the average for each of the London
new towns is roughly the same except at Hatfield,
where it is much lower, and Stevenage, where it
is much higher.
