At the centre of each circle stood personnel
managers of corporations, together with professors
and their filing clerks. The students had
bought their college education forward and
were now being bought forward in their
turn. By comparing personal appearances
with university records, the agents of the
businesses would pick on young men
and women who interested them, and contracts
would be initialled at the end of
the parade.
