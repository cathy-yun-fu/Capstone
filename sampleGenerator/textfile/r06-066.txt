Then here was Nice, and the old holiday
sea, blue as a new school exercise
book. The same old Nice, creamy,
vulgar, out of time, bitter-sweet with
the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur
to the old sleeping port. This, and
Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I
could catch the taste of dead dreams on
my tongue like spray.
