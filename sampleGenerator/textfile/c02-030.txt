When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a
marvellous joke; no one has learned anything. Wicki
suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In
complete silence he shows the faces of people
walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied,
and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has
succeeded in his second film in
recording his personal apocalypse of the
last days of a sick society.
