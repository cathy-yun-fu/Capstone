From the day it hatches in the spring
until it dies in the late autumn, the
praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
eating other insects. Nine blowflies
may be consumed at one sitting and
the fully adult, 2 1/2-in.-long insect,
is able to keep a firm hold on one
grasshopper while eating another.
According to Dr. Max Beier in &quot;Fang-
heuschrecken&quot; (Die Neue Brehm Bu&quot;ckerei,
1952), the praying mantis is trecking
northwards.
