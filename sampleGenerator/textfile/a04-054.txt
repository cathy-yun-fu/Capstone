That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine.
So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons,
the West, somewhere, must have them too. It
was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.
This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
to oppose the Polaris depot ship.
