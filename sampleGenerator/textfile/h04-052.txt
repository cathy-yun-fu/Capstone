All groups except families with four or more children
or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
vegetables, especially in the first half of the year, although most
reduced their consumption of other vegetables. Purchases of
quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extreme-
ly wide group differences persisted, the averages ranging from
0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
households; average consumption by older couples and other
wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week.
