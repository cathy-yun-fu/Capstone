Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
of the party since it came to office three and
a half years ago. Nevertheless there is little
illusion in the Conservative Party that their
stock at home has fallen in the face of
heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy.
