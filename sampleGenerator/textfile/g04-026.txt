First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had
any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an
old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well
and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to
teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by
the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
could render simple part-singing tolerably well.
