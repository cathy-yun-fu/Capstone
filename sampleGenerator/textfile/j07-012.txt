Furthermore, developments in the detail form of
the fins made possible a reduction in the total
surface area required as compared with the use of
smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
duty and pressure losses. The properties of
compact form, low weight, and design flexibility
thus developed found ready application on a
much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
scale air separation plants.
