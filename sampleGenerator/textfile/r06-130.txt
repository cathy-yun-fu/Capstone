At the entrance of the cinema the
doorman was lying in wait for anyone
who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine
by her suffering arm, he said bitterly:
'Yes, why are you crying, he had to be
punished for his crime, didn't he?' Cathe-
rine stared at him, incredulous. Philip
rescued her by saying with disdain:
'Some people don't know right from wrong
even when its demonstrated to them.'
