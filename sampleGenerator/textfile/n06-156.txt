'Light an' come on in.&quot; We dismounted and
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Dowd took our horses off to water.
We followed Nick Dowd into the shack.
They'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
miners followed in at our heels. Nick Dowd
found us a couple of boxes to sit on.
