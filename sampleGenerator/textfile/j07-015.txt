The basic method of construction is both simple and
extremely flexible. Figure 3 illustrates the
arrangement of a single passage. This can be
extended in length and width up to the limit of
manufacturing equipment available. The corrugation
is machine-formed, thus ensuring a high standard
of uniformity in height and fin pitch.
