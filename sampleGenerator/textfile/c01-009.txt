The production by Bill Duncalf
compressed a long and sometimes rambling
story into a concentrated comprehensive
survey of a life work. P. J. K. HANS WERNER
HENZE'S &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; is the first
unambiguously &quot;contemporary&quot; work to be
admitted to the Glyndebourne canon. By no
means a masterpiece, it is in many respects
a representative modern work and the composer
is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
idioms, with a strong sense of words and situation.
