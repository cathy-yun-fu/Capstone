Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen:
(a) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches,
the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
outside edge. Oversew crochet to button stitch.
(b) Turn under a small hem, with fold lying on line
of basting stitches. Work a row of dc all round
this hem, with 3 dc at each corner.
