In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an
old man. Here it is a young homosexual, estranged
from women but yet moved by a strong maternal
instinct to the unborn child as much as to the
expectant mother, who acts as a protector and
comforter to her in her hour of need. He
shares her room and gives her his forlorn gift
of companionship and sympathy - &quot;you need someone
to love you while you are looking for
someone to love&quot;.
