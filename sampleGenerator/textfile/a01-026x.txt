Mr. Iain Macleod, the Colonial Secretary, denied
in the Commons last night that there have
been secret negotiations on the Northern Rhodesia's
future. The Northern Rhodesia conference in
London has been boycotted by the two main
settlers' parties - the United Federal Party
and the Dominion Party. But representatives
of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the
Central African Federation, went to Chequers
at the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.
