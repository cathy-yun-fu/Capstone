Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a
large majority of Labour 0M Ps are likely to turn
down the Foot-Griffiths resolution. Mr. Foot's line
will be that as Labour 0M Ps opposed the Govern-
ment Bill which brought life peers into existence, they
should not now put forward nominees. He believes
that the House of Lords should be abolished and
that Labour should not take any steps which would
appear to &quot;prop up&quot; an out-dated institution.
