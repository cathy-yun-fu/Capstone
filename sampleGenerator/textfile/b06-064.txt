Powerful units have stood firm.
In unions where the central issues
were confused, clear policy details -
as on bases - were decisively carried.
This, and the numbers of active
workers who are beginning to understand
how and why the trick was done,
provides a strong, immediate basis
for a campaign against weak and
doubtful positions, and for a consistent
peace policy.
