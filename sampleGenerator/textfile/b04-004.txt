In Ghana, President Nkrumah, who
has done more than most to stir up
trouble in the Congo, orders every Belgian
citizen to quit his country. HOUNDING
Belgium has become an international
pastime. Why? Because those who
said the Congolese could govern themselves
will not admit they were wrong. So
Belgium, bowed down by internal
troubles, mourning a terrible air crash,
is made their scapegoat.
