Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
Market, even if it meant an unconditional surrender.
There were also brief discussions on Laos, Berlin
and other foreign questions, after Mr. Kennedy had
informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
Krushchov. With the exception of 40 minutes when
Lord Home, Foreign Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge
Bundy, the President's special assistant for
security affairs, were brought in, the two
men talked alone.
