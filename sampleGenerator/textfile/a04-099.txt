&quot;Such retaliation might, and probably would,
destroy the whole population of Britain in

British membership of Nato and British
permission of American bases on our territory
add anything to the strength of America,
while, on the contrary, they impose upon
America an onerous obligation which it
may prove impossible to fulfil.&quot;
