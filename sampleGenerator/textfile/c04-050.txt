Their offering last night differed little
from their earlier act on this show a week
or so ago. But the Mudlarks, with Jeff Mudd
out of the Army and back with sister Mary
and brother Fred, were in bright, zestful
form. Why only two numbers, though? It
was not enough. &quot;A FAIR COP,&quot; the B B C
Whitehall farce last night, looked like
a rabbit warren in a field of corn.
