Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
continuing till old age to-day. When I went
to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was
with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton
and his family, the youngest of whose three
sons was just coming into the world in this year
of 1913.
