All recent events show how correct the
Scarborough decisions were. The Kennedy
Administration's sharpened policies, the
speeded-up drive to improve West
Germany's armament, the new attempt
to rush Britain into the European Common
Market, and the kite-flying on Spain
present a whole new proof that to abandon
Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
working class to sharp new dangers - that
Gaitskellism is bankrupt.
