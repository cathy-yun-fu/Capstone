The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
more than a fantasy. Thanks to the good
sense of the front line soldiers, the
meeting of East and West was marked by

vodka. And the effect on the German people
of the first ten years of the promised
thousand of Nazi rule, so far from creating
a spirit of warlike frenzy, had produced
universally a dull bewildered apathy.
