IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as
Vicar of St. Mark's, Woodcote, Purley, a new church built
by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne,
who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was
later on joint executor of his estate with his
solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held
great family consultations.
