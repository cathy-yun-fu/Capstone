This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived
throughout in terms of the cinema, and again
and again it is the visual qualities of the
story, and the marriage of the central charac-
ters to their background, which bring the
film so vividly to life. In Fanny, which
also has its premiere tomorrow, the director,
Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed to
create the atmosphere of a city.
