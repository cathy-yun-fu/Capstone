John's father had been a naval officer of the old
school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation. One of these was that
an officer should join a ship, on taking up a
new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed
in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
It would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways
instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
sticking.
