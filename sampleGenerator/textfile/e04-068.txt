I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
rowing this dinghy (Fig. 3). They are very simple, cheap
and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan
there is only a single gunwale on the outside.
I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
is difficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome
this in another way as shown in Fig. 4.
