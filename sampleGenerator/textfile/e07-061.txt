Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
egg-case of the Chinese mantis. The
first mantis had hatched from the very large
egg-case on June 6. Both the Chinese
and Spanish mantis, in the young stage
at any rate, are light brown in colour.
Because of the cool, wet weather, I had great
difficulty in breeding fruit flies and, after
many of the mantis of both types had died
in my Kilner jars, I poured living mantis
over vines and peachtrees.
