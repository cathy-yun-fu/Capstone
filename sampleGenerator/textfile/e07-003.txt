Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it
does the balance of nature by killing both pests
and predators, is viewed with concern by a
number of American State Research Stations. Not
content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture,
some stations are carrying out useful research on
pest control by biological means. Both native and
imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
are used in field trial tests.
