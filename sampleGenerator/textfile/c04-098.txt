But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY'S Russ
Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But
nothing crazy about his pianistics. He pounds merrily away
at a piece called "Piccadilly" (Polydor). I find it cute.
American pianist Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on "It's
Now or Never," looks like having a success on his own with
"On the Rebound" (RCA).
