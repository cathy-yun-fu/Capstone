His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several
communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is
satirical: 'I have not the 1honor of any acquaintance with Mr
Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when Count
Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....'
If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British
Government's other representatives in the islands, while they
warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far to
explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young
Italian's expense.
