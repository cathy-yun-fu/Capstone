The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty:
the first of these is due in 1963. Meanwhile, each
'graduate' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
working out his ideas, either through the company's
personnel department or by an approach to
members of the panel responsible for the scheme.
