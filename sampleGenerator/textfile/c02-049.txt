Strangely enough, the Berlin audience received
the film with extreme coolness, much preferring
Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing &quot;Une Femme
est une Femme,&quot; a ninety-one minute hymn
to &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Cahiers du Cinema,&quot; and the
worst aspects of the American cinema. From
a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles
out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
uninitiated (including four plugs for Charles
Aznavour).
