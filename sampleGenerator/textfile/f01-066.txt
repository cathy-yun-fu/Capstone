And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
&quot;mind&quot; vanishes, at any rate for some time. It seems very difficult
to detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological,
surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the
word &quot;soul&quot; to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word &quot;mind&quot; for
the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
are clearly associated with the brain.
