The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
today, however, that the Brussels Treaty
was irrelevant, because research on the
various rocket stages had already been
concluded, and only cooperation on the type
of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle
to German participation is the absence of
any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
for it - and therefore of any budget
under which funds could be appropriated.
