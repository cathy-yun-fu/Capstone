The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
later in this Report. They have, up to now,
been included in the Memorandum on
the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
which is prepared by the Home Office
for the information of doctors and
dentists.
