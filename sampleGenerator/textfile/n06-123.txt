&quot;The mine-workings lie north of the town,&quot;
said Dan. &quot;If we head west we ought to
cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north.&quot;
So we swung west, making slow going over
rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down
into draws, circling a big mesa by a
four or five mile valley, sandy-floored. It
got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
gratefully by a small creek where we watered
the horses and drank enough to cure our
thirst.
