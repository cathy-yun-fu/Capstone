In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
taken a town in the industrial North of England
and has made it live. The shabby streets and
wet pavements, the school play-grounds, the
public monuments and the rubbish strewn canals -
even the worn head-stones in the churchyard,
&quot;sacred to the memory of&quot; - are seen as an
integral part of the story.
