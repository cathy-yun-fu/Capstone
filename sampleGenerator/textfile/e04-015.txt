Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
fits up against the front legs of the
chair. The seat rests across the upper two
cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
glued and panel pinned in position, measurements
being taken directly from the work. Fig. 4
shows the framework for the back which
is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber.
