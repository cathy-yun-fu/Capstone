From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
and informed him of the Vienna outcome. Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
fly home with the President. In DUESSELDORF, Chancellor Adenauer
said the Vienna talks &quot;might be the beginning of a slight improvement,&quot;
but no big changes should be expected in the political situation.
