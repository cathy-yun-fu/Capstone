All types of trader have been encouraged,
from the large departmental store to #
the small shoe-mender, with banks specially
sited on corners or in separate courts to avoid
breaking into the shopping frontage. As in the
case of factories and industrial sites, the
corporations' policy has been to charge full commercial
rents for their shops and shopping sites. The
cost of town centre development has been very
high in some cases with large paved areas
and pleasant amenities and decorative features.
