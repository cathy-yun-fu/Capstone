What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded
by his publishers in March of last year? Still a skeleton. Yet
I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of
a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish
Rebel which was delivered to his agents in June. IT
begins: &quot;There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's
return from her abortion in Bristol.&quot;
