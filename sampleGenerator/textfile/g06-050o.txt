Mauro's first action was to write to his re-
vered master at Ko"then, near Leipzig,
asking for advice. In doing so he descri-
bed his distinguished patient and his
symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found
Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a
gentle and charming character, even-tem-
pered and sedate, not easily irritated,
patient and persevering, 'but he appears
to despair of ever being cured.'
