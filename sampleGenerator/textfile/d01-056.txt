The most convenient one for the authors
has been the text of A. Souter. In this
version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
printed as just over 1,000 different nouns,
verbs, and other parts of speech occurring
15,695 times in their different grammatical
forms. There are other texts which could
have been used, and (as shown in Table 1)
it is not a matter of the greatest importance
which text is used.
