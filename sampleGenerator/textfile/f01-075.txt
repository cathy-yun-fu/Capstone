At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were
identified as elementary sensations. These were
thought to combine together to form compound
experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
matter combine to form molecular compounds.
But this view led to too many difficulties and
was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search
for basic units of mind has gone on and will
doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to
discover ultimate units.
