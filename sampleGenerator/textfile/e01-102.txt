Remember that texture plays an important part in
the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads
are more effective for the delicate designs used for
tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while
the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks
are made of steel, composition or bone. Steel
crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0,
the largest, to number 8, the smallest.
