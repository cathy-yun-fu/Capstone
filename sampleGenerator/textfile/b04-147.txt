AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
Board. The board is laying a cable along a seven-
mile route in Surrey. A warden, Mr. Jack Finlay,
has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
householders when trenches are dug outside their
front gates. Splendid. By showing concern
for the people the board will earn their good will.
Happy patrolling, Mr. Finlay!
