I can't recall a production where so many
comics bolted in and out of holes so often.
The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
of his trousers. The action moved at tremendous
speed, backed by some wonderful timing by
the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup
scene where six of the cast changed
cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
