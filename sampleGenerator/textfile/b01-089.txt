The big Powers involved in the Cold War
must of course keep out. The Americans were
justified in diverting naval ships in case
non-combatant help was wanted; but they
stressed that there was no intention to intervene
in fighting. Yesterday the ships turned away
again, satisfied that they were not required.
It is to be hoped that the UN will be
re-established in their port by negotiation
and that there will be no more outrages.
