One called La Patriote is Communist, and at the time
of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal
tomatoes at General de Gaulle. One side of this square
is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar. For one
day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been
hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an
elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest,
had firmly closed the door in our noses.
