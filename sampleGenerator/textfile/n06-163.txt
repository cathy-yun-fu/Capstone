A small man in bib overalls and a battered
Derby hat fussed around the stove. &quot;2Ain't
exactly the Ritz Hotel but we've got our little
comforts,&quot; said Dowd. He introduced the men
who'd come in as Roper Smith, Shorty, Mick
Golightly, Swede and the Sodbuster. This last was
the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
sweetened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans.
