Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
as from Nov. 1. The hand-over, due in
September, was delayed because of the
Berlin crisis. Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
felt the change would be unwise at a
moment # when attention had to be
concentrated on possible need for important
military operations. For this reason Sir
Francis stayed on, and # sacrificed
his leave.
