It was quite amusing to see how much
the children enjoyed the service, and I heard
of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
naughty child with the penalty of not being
allowed to come to the Children's Church
on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat
kept them good in the week, but anyway
they were a most delightful lot, and
it is a great joy to meet them now
fifty years afterwards when so many
are parents or even grandparents
