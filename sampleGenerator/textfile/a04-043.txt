MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
defence of the Polaris missile base. And by
implication he supported the establishment of
sites in Britain for the training of German
troops. His main theme was that nuclear
weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that
Britain must depend on Nato and &quot;the West&quot;
must have nuclear weapons so long as the
Soviet Union has them.
