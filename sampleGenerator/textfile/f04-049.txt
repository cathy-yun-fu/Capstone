This man was known to have left his home on February 11, and
to have been away for four days. Not in itself a crime, but, added to
the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
dford for a false moustache, it left him with something to
explain. His story was that he had left home to try to
join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
his military bearing), and this was accepted.
