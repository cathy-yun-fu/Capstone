The skeleton of the boat will now take shape,
and this is the time to check before making fast
to see that nothing is distorted. Ensure that
the outside measurements from transom to transom
are equal on each side and that the transoms
are parallel horizontally. Next bevel the chines
with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly.
