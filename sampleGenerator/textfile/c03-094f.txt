Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensi-
tively pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife,
always palely appealing, Mr. James Maxwell,
the editor, always comically abashed by
the events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the
father-in-law, always comically grotesque;
they were not asked to modulate from
their set moods but played with proper
efficiency and, in the case of Mr. Richards,
with lavish and suitably gaudy colour.
