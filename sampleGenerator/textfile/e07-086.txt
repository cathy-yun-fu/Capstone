It is not easy to make an economic
comparison between clay pots and the various
substitutes; the former may last indefinitely
with luck, while the latter are often
expendable used only once. Clay pots are
efficient and congenial containers in which
to grow plants. In their proper setting they
are not unattractive and, in spite of
their shortcomings, most gardeners have
a nostalgic affection for them.
