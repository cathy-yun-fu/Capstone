The lower platen, which supports the
leather, is raised hydraulically to bring
it into contact with the rollers on the upper
platen, which is then caused to make
several horizontal oscillations so that the
leather is rolled and pressed at the same time.
The danger zone between the platens is fenced
by a guard which is interlocked with the
hydraulic valve and the press is also
sequentially operated: the closing of the shutter
starts the machine, the rest of the cycle
following automatically.
