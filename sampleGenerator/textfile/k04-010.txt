The party was now preparing to see
the tapestries, and in the general
movement, Vittoria was separated from
Orsini. Although neither of them
wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed
no alternative. As she was about to mount
a wide and shallow flight of marble
stairs, she became aware of someone
watching her intently, and turning
in that direction, she saw Olimpia,
standing beside her admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti.
