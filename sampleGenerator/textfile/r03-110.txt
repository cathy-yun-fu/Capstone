&quot;You see,&quot; she propounded to Rupert after her last patient
had gone, &quot;we can get three thousand three fifty,
perhaps a little more if we can cheat your earnings
a bit. I'm sure you could raise the rest from
one of your publishers, get two books commissioned
and write them later. I've got a bit owing too.
Now, I saw some flats in Hendon for four thou,
and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty,
two beds, two reception, k. and b., just think,
our own bathroom.
