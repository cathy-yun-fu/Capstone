A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
Buganda (King Freddie) from Princess
Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro, kneeling at the
foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport
yesterday. Forty other Africans greeted him,
kneeling with heads bowed. The princess,
aged 24, is now studying history at Cambri-
dge, where she is a friend of Prince William
of Gloucester.
