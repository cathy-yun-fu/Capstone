The large attendance and atmosphere of
this Conference, held in October, 1957,
reflected not only an increasing awareness
of the problems of men and women nearing
or already in retirement but also a strong
desire on the part of all concerned for
concerted action towards preparing men
and women for life in retirement and more
adequate provision of facilities for
crafts, hobbies and leisure-time interests
for those who are retired.
