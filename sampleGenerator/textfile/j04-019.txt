The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed
for ten days and showed no abnormalities.
Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha-
ve been well below one percent. Some separa-
ted lead-210 was used to make reference stan-
dards and as a tracer in recovery experiments.
There was no significant difference between the-
se results and those obtained using the original
lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical
Centre which we concluded was radiochemi-
cally pure.
