THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
tonight from their tour in the East. The duke's
trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
have taken the headlines in this country.
Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense
success. The Queen has won a triumph. It
would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
dropped from future Royal programmes.
