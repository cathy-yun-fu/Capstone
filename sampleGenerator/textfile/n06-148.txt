I saw several men running down towards
the shack. They were all armed with rifles.
As the nearest of them came round the
shack, his rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick
Dowd, still wearing his blue check shirt. He
came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. &quot;We've
come 2a-calling,&quot; I said. &quot;Can't see no reason
for calling,&quot; he said. &quot;Still long as you're here
you may as well stay a while.
