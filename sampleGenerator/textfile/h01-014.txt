Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
about housing and households. In 1961 the scope of the
question was wider than before, because of the great
use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government and to local authorities. As before, the record
made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residen-
tial premises and temporary places of abode, and all
households occupying them, as the basis of the
enumeration is the household schedule.
