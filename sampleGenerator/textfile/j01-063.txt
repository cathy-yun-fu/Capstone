Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is
minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel
conductor by nickel circlips. Fixing and
positioning of the probe relative to the coolant
stream is effected by tie-bars of insulating
material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the
water cooled flange G.
