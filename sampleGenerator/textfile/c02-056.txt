This director is at last being re-evaluated and
given his proper place in the history of the
German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
&quot;Unheimliche Geschichten&quot; (1920), five ghost stories
with a light touch, and there was much to admire
in &quot;Dreyfus&quot; (1930) and the virtually unknown
but extremely important &quot;1914&quot; (1931), which
tries to show that it took more than just
Germany to start the First World War.
