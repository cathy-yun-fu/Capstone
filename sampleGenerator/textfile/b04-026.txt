The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
Britain today! &quot;THIS is colour day,&quot; proclaimed the American
television network, N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its
programmes in bright colours. In America colour TV is five years
old. There are already 600,000 sets in use. What about Britain?
The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service, but the
commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years.
