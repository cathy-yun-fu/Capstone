According to Pliny, and others, certain
herbs and flowers proved of sovereign
power in preventing the approaches of
ebriety, or, as Bassius less clearly
expresses it, in clarifying the functions
of the brain. It is said that there is
nothing new under the sun, but regarding
foodstuffs the traveller occasionally
encounters a certain measure of novelty.
