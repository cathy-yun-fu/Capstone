My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
his family, and found a very suitable house nearby
where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926
at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present
at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's.
This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich,
Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was
a close friend of ours.
