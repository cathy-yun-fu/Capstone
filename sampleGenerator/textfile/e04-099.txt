Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two
lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from
the other. If care is taken not to waste the
ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.
