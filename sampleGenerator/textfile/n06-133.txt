We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short
of the diggings there was a roughly-built
shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
out, &quot;If you come any closer, I'll sure blow
your whiskers off.&quot; &quot;Take it easy, mister,&quot; I sang
out. &quot;We don't aim to come any closer and we've
got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you
go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
to him about what happened last night.&quot;
