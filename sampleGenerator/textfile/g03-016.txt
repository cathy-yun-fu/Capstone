(In this strike, as reported in the Sheffield
Guardian in March of that year, 1,000,000
men were out a fortnight, disciplined and solid,
when only 20 per cent of them stood to gain
anything from the strike and the other 80 per
cent made sacrifices for their fellow men;
this remarkable strike raised the question of a
living wage and showed the worth of the
common man.)
