After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
grandchildren who had sat, rather intimidated
by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
Gibbons carving around the fireplace, rose
gratefully from the table, leaving the two
men together. A nurse came in, and asked
the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
helped out on to the lawn, but he waved
her away impatiently.
