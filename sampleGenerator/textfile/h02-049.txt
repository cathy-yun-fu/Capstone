The Secretary of State was empowered, on the recommendation of a
tribunal, to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply
dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor, or a doctor
convicted of an offence under the Act, should not issue
prescriptions for dangerous drugs. (3) It was made clear
that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
medical practitioner when required for purposes of
medical treatment.
