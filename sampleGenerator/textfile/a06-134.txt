The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday. They
tell: The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
treaty with Germany causes no real danger. West Germany,
with its militarists and revenge-seekers, is becoming a
hotbed of war danger in Europe. Even now, aided by
the U.S., Britain and France, it has more than enough
forces and arms to touch off a world war.
