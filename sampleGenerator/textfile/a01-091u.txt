The result of the vote was not in doubt.
For the Tories were massed in answer to
their whips to defeat a censure motion
on the Government for &quot;undermining the
Health Service&quot; and placing heavy burdens
on those least able to bear them. Mr.
Brown declared that the policy under
censure was monstrous. It had offended
many people far beyond the ranks of
Labour supporters.
