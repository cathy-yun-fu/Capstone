The most clearly substantiated case
is that of the copepod Anomalocera
patersoni, which remains permanently
at the surface. Among other copepods
Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus,
Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oithona
frigida, and Centropages typicus are
reported as showing no migration.
The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
longimanus also remains at one
level, about 10 meters down.
