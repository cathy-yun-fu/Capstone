The police began a systematic search of the line -
no easy task, but one in which patience and method
paid off. At a spot on the embankment between
Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs
sticking to it. The murder weapon, more than likely,
and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
killer to book in modern times.
