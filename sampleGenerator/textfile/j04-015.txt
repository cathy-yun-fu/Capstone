Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
precipitates need be known because the concentration
of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
algebraic equations. An effort was made to
detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting
of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
minutes of completing the separation.
