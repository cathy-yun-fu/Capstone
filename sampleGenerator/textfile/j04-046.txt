The presence and growth of algae in the
alkaline effluent does not prevent the
recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
conditions although some radioactivity remains
on the algae until the metathesis has been
completed by heating the mixed sulphates
with three separate portions of dilute (1.25
normal) sodium carbonate solution. The
strength of the carbonate solution was
chosen after experiments with lead tracer
alone which indicated that less lead was
