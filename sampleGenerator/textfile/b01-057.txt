A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine, paid
for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament.
Those who lend their names to this kind of
advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent
of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the
idea that moral regeneration would solve
all our problems. So it would. While we are
waiting for the millenium, however, most of us
would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
instruments of democracy, such as trade unions
and our local and national Parliaments.
