Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon,
and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M., where
she had tea with her other sister, and then
went to catch the 7.42. Her sister saw her
to the station, helping her with some of
her packages. This sister was able to establish
that she had carried a green purse and
had bought a railway ticket.
