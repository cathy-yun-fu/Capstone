ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as &quot;a
policy of good neighbourliness.&quot; We may be sure that
he is not being hypocritical. That is what he
really believes. A good neighbour to those Africans
who, under apartheid, will be forced back to
their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
cramped and primitive existence.
