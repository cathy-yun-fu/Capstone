The body was examined, and it was definitely
established that no sexual assault had taken place.
It seemed probable that the motive had been
robbery, and this was further confirmed when a
check was made with the woman's relations in
Hounslow. Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. Her day
off was Thursday, and before coming up to London
in the evening she had called on her two sisters,
one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
other at Hounslow, where she kept a shop.
