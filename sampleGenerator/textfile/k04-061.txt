The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery
of Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her
restless spirit, all threw into sharp relief the contrast
of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien,
and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
to give her a separate establishment, he invariably
pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who
had built the villa for his family.
