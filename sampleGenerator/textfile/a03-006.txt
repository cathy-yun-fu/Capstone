Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of Indo-
nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
Foreign Minister. In fact such Yugoslav activity has
been # particularly intensified in the past year
or so and though so far, apart from joint action
in the United Nations, these exchanges have not
been seen on any wider basis, President Tito
is known for some time to have favoured a
conference of neutralist leaders.
