Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make
this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June, made it
very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity
that the Government should ever have been led away
from this principle. It is a great pity that the
Government should give the appearance of responding, not
to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations, but to
the violence which he tried to prevent.
