Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian
parties had refused to attend the talks
because Sir Roy had found messages
sent from the Government were &quot;unsatisfac-
tory.&quot; African delegates to the talks yester-
day called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his
negotiations with Sir Roy's representative,
Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Che-
quers last week-end. They said they
regarded with &quot;growing anger&quot; the &quot;gross
and unconstitutional&quot; interference by
Sir Roy's Federal Government in the
talks.
