Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
Kaunda. Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister,
said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
National Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda
until he was outlawed in 1959. The record
of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
back a long way, Sir Roy told the
Federal Parliament in Salisbury.
