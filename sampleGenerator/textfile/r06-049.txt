Monsieur V's house was immediately
surrounded by firemen and other officials,
but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
a few minutes later from a nearby village,
apologising for the trouble, but explaining
that the walls were porous and the
gas had escaped. General relief was
expressed, but Monsieur V (this was
actually reported in the next issue) returned
home and shot himself, leaving a note
which again left his household goods
