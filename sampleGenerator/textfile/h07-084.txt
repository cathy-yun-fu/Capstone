Londoners not in housing need, # but whose departure
from London may be assumed to release accommodation
there, are recruited for jobs which cannot be filled through
the industrial # selection scheme, and only as a last
resort are people from outside London allotted new town
houses. As a result, almost 80 per cent of the #
houses let by the development # corporations in the
London new towns have gone to Londoners, about
half of whom are known to have been on local
authority housing lists.
