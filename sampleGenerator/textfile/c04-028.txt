Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
also effectively around. They provide some chilly red
herrings in this &quot;Find-the-body&quot; thriller. VERDICT:
Don't believe all you see and hear!
NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney
James has pumped life into a slim, strained
comedy. He does his rescue act in &quot;Double Bunk&quot;
(Leicester-square Theatre, &quot;A&quot;).
