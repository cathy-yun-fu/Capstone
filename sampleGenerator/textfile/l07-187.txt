From this side, Rivermead was less forbidding;
it stood a long way back from the water
at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an
ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria; it
was built across a narrow backwater
and there was a delicate iron staircase
climbing the outer wall to a room above.
