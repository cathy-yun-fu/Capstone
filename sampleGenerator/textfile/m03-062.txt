Small, repulsive creatures they were,
with black, matted hair and a striking
resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
gazed at recently; and I have no
hesitation in saying that they would have
made an end of us but for an intervention
so unexpected, so unusual, that only the
necessity of rounding my narrative
compels me to mention it.
