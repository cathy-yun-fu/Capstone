Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step
in the direction of live-and-let-live. Hopes
will now grow brighter of further international
co-operation, which is the only way to solve the
payments difficulties that upset the Western world.
Britain and the U.S., which have problems with
their balances, will gain some immediate help.
What it means in practical terms is that our
exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
for Germans to buy, while the goods which
Germany exports will be made a little dearer.
