It's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle, but I
don't think it was through boredom. The film is funny enough
in places and has a line or two of painful home truths
thrown in. &quot;I don't want to talk like an adult,&quot; screams
Gina, walking out on the man who has so far
failed to make an honest woman of her.
