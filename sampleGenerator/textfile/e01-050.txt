During the sixteenth century a considerable
amount of crochet was produced in the
convents of Europe. Without doubt it was the
nuns who carried the craft to Ireland. There it
was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
form with rosettes, leaves and lace fillings. During
the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
greatly abused.
