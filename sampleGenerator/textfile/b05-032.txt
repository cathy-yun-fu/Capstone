The travellers from the New World who had
been in Britain many times before, were
slightly stunned. Afterwards they said: &quot;We thought
we knew it all, but you Britishers never run
out of unturned stones.&quot;
To the British Travel Association, doing their excellent
darndest, I offer these sad complexities. IN the 1830's
the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
many a good trade unionist since then has, in the
hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers, taken
the theoretical Luddite hammer again.
