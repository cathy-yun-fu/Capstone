Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary
to the Treasury, said yesterday that the
Government does not like retrospective legislation.
He went on to describe the kind of
people the Chancellor hopes to tax. These
are people buying and selling shares within
a short period, those &quot;stagging&quot; on a new issue
and property dealers who form a chain of
companies and put one property deal through
each.
