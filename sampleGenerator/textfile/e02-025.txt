Note that squared lines marking
the top member of the toe are
needed as well as the upper ex-
tent of the taper, and in
this case it is necessary to
mark in the line of the taper
with pencil and straight-edge
as at (B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is
made at the upper toe line
exactly down to the taper line,
no farther.
