The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's
third talks - the first were at Key West, Florida, the second in
Washington - said: &quot;Their discussions covered the major problems,
both economic and political, and revealed once again the
close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
common purposes. &quot;Occasion was given to review the need for
economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests
of developed and underdeveloped countries alike.&quot;
