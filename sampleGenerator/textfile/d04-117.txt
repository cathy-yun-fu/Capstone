Leaning back carries the concealed message. And we
start the Seder showing the Matzos, that they rep-
resent the &quot;Bread of Poverty&quot; which our fore-fathers
were eating in Mitzrajim, to show they were willing to learn;
and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our
discussions, saying: &quot;Anybody who is hungry, let him come
and eat, Anybody who is thirsty, let him come and
drink.&quot;
