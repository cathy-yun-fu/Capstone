Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
using double standards. Ministers had
rebuked the unaligned nations for not
condemning the new Russian tests, but
they themselves had no condemnation for
events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for
the Government, said Mr. Healey, to
take up moral attitudes, &quot;especially when
the temple of their religion is the
bingo-parlour.&quot;
