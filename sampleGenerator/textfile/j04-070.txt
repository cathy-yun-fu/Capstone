Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
interfere. Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
the first wash. The resin is used for a single
separation and then thrown away. In the first stage
of the analysis, only the fraction containing
lead-210 is collected. The lead is precipitated as
the chromate, washed, slurried onto an aluminium
counting tray, dried under an infra-red lamp,
weighed, and set aside for five days while the
bismuth-210 grows in.
