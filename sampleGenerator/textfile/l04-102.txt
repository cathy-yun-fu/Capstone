When he closed his eyes it was
Henry Mansell's face he saw, hovering
above his head like a hideous caricature. The
parrot nose and straight line of the mouth,
the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
him right down to his abjectly quaking
bones. The mouldering horror that had
once been Henry Mansell taunted him
now in the silent darkness.
