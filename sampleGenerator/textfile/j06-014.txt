Such reversed migrations are known for
Acartia clausi, A. longiremis, Nyctiphanes
couchii, Evadne sp., Oithona nana, Daphnia
lumholzi, Stages 4, 5, and adult of
Calanus finmarchicus, Diaptomus banforanus,
and Cyclops bicuspidatus. An echo-producing
layer, which the authors think probably consists
of euphausiids, has also been described
as, in part, regularly moving in a reverse
manner. Most of these records are well
substantiated and involve whole populations
rather than aberrant individuals.
