Yes. I'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more
than three thousand three fifty at the most. Now you
could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in
Grimstead for three thousand, that's where I live, just
before the green belt, lovely and modern, you know.
I forgot to tell you, we don't usually lend any
house built earlier than 1918.&quot;
