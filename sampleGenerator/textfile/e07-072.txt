DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
since the end of the war, clay pots are
still in greatest demand. It is mostly
in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
have made headway, and although
numerous small clay pots are used each
year, they are fewer than they were 10
years ago. In the larger sizes there is still
no real substitute for clay that can be
obtained at a comparable price, except the
bituminized paper pots which are used on
commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
