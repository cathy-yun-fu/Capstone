The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
play A Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester
Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been pro-
duced and directed by Mr. Tony Richardson,
who is also part-author with Miss Delaney
of the script, and the great advantages to
be derived from this unity of conception and
control are everywhere apparent.
