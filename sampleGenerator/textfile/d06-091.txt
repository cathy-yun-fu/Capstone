There may be some who will argue that
routine destroys the soul. It is so easy,
they say, to get into a rut. Save us
from the school curriculum and even
worse the school system whereby for
meals everybody knows beforehand
exactly what, on any given day of the
week, they are going to have. If - such
a critic may say - you are calling
us to adventure, do not strangle us before
we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
