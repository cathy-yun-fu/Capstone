Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the
development corporations, about 20 per cent represents
extensions built after the firms had become established.
It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
sites; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
for factory accommodation.
