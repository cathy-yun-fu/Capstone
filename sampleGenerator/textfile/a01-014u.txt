Sir Roy's United Federal Party is
boycotting the London talks on the
Protectorate's future. Said Mr. Nkumbula
last night: &quot;We want to discuss what to
do if the British demonstrations.&quot;
Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide, Mr.
Julius Greenfield, telephoned his chief
a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan
at Chequers.
