It was called &quot;Abou Ben Adhem and the
Angel.&quot; I don't know why I was so
impressed with this poem but, on re-
flection, it might be that I took a
guilty interest in the devilment busi-
ness. I may well have felt that I was
hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
upbringing and a possible reprieve might
come through the sugary sentiments
of &quot;Abou Ben Adhem.&quot;
