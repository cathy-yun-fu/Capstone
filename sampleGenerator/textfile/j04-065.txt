The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
(lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve is shown in
Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight
of resin used is also fixed. All available evidence indicates
that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
of cross contamination apart from the natural
ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
lead.
