The flat was on the third floor; two rooms; soft Provenc*?
6al view; good intimate furnishing and colour; running
hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up,
basin and bidet; own private, modern lavatory. The
first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence.
We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
eruption of turtle-doves.
