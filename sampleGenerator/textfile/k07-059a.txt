He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently
led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but
had never trodden. He learned how to use his
hands, how to adore that body without haste, how
to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to
creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd
dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened
his heart beat to a thunder.
