The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82)
has always differed from that of the
summer fisheries. There is the &quot;swim&quot;
at slack waters, even in daylight
sometimes; and the high swimming,
when fish are caught only in the top
few yards of netting. These and other
fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
to this fishery, which unfortunately seems
to be dying out; but a full discussion of
them is beyond the present scope.
