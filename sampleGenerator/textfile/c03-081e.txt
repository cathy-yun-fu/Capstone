Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
technical error in allowing Irene to speak
for herself; we would be altogether clearer
in our minds about her if she remained
a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but
not heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone
makes her few brief scenes effective, and
Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in the longest and most
exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives a perfor-
mance of rare intelligence and restrained
power.
