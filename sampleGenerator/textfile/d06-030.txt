Amen. MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only
partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be
effective, must be of that child-like quality which comes
from innocence.
