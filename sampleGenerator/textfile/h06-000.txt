To provide fuller information about certain types of
dangerous occurrence, Section 65 of the Factories Act,
1937, requires notification of certain specified
occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories,
whether or not they result in injury. Appendix 20
gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in
1960; the types of occurrence which have to be
reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix.
