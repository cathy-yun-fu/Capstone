For in the old order of things, men designed
and worked lace as well as women and
special schools were set up to teach lace-
making not only to young girls, but to little
boys as well. Whole families made their
livelihood by lace-making and consequently
a folklore of song, festival and courtship grew
up around the lace industry.
