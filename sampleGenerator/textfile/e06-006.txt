The effect of bottom congestion due to
the light pressure is inevitably mixed
with that of the suitability of ground
for spawning. Both result in crowding,
so there is no need to try to separate
them - thank Heaven! A good picture of
this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
grounds from the Viking in the north down
to the Klondykes and the Reef along
the western edge of the Norwegian
Deep.
