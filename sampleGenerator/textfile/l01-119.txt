One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both
about to enter the house. Fred grasped his brother's elbow.
&quot;Nick, I can't stomach this much longer.&quot; &quot;Nor me. What's the
answer? Mum's picking up, but she'll never be her old self
again.&quot;
&quot;That First Flower's driving me nuts,&quot; Fred said. &quot;I'm going to put
a stop to it.&quot;
&quot;What with - arsenic?&quot;
