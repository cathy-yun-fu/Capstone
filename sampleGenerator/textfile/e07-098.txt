Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them
in the normal way, the only real difference
being that more of the watering is done through a
rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
of water. First-class plants of tomatoes,
cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers,
celery and onions, may all be raised in soil
blocks; so can such flowering plants as
dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas,
lupins and numerous others.
