Gay, a little puzzled, went through
to the bar. Doc and Lilyan were
sitting just inside having coffee.
&quot;Come and join us and bring your
boy friend,&quot; Doc called. &quot;No, Doc!&quot;
Lilyan remonstrated. &quot;They want to be
alone.&quot; &quot;I've booked a table at the
cafe*?2,&quot; Doc said, &quot;they are packed
tonight so come and join us if you
can't find a table for two.&quot;
