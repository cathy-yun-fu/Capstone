You are out of date. Cricket in 1961 is played
with a theodolite, six surveyors, a ball;
bats and wickets between two sides. Shades
of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who
are now the patron saints of the game!
What would THEY have thought of
these civil engineers creeping about
the pitch with their optical
instruments?
