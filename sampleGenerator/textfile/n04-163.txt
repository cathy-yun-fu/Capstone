&quot;Ever been to Fleet Street?&quot; asked Bawley.
&quot;You should. Next time you're in Town
give me a ring at this number and I'll
take you round the pubs where most
of the work is done.&quot; He held out a card.
John took it and put it in his pocket.
&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;If ever my missus
lets me off the chain I'll take you
up on that.
