This week of window dressing will not prevent
most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
jobs. It needs more than 10,000 church parades
and open days at techs, more than descents into
Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
catch up with the space age.
