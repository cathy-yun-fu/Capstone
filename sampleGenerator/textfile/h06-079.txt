The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
guard on the jib of the crane, intended to
prevent direct contact with the line, and
electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
mounted slightly forward of the head of the
jib and with electronic assembly
and warning apparatus in the driver's
cab. Improved designs of both forms
are being tried out at present.
