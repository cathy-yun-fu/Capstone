It has been left, however, to Mr. Goka, Ghana's Finance
Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity
he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
Hotel. POLICE, on direct orders from the Cabinet, are
openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
disarming Committee of 100, the Committee claimed
yesterday. It said pressure was being put on
members and associates all over the country.
