Table 1 shows the decontamination factors
obtained experimentally for ten radionuclides,
accompanied in two instances by radioactive dau-
ghters. The decontamination factor falls below
104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95
with their daughters in the first stage, i.e.
the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-
21 daughter. When the second stage (the bismuth
phosphate source) is completed, the decontami-
nation factors are exceptionally high.
