I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
old, star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
Hollywood. His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have
recently given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet
treatment. But they haven't done a thing for his film
career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
doing better here, before the platinum-plated Hollywood
carrot was dangled before his nose.
