This loss is acceptably small for an analytical
step when no correction for carrier
recovery is possible. The completeness
of the chemical exchange between the
bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
also tested. Two samples of precipitated
lead chromate (lead-210, bismuth-210)
were counted and dissolved in nitric
acid in silica basins. The contents
were evaporated to dryness with
bismuth carrier and then taken up in
