A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
imprisoned in England. His son, in revenge, was
harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg,
and doing it to some purpose. John Philpot,
one of that new class of merchant financiers
which the city of London was now producing, fitted,
equipped and manned a fleet from his own
resources, and captured the young Mercer in a
brilliant Channel fight.
