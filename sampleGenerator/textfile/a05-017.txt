The Minister regards the recent trend
of recruiting figures as encouraging.
He is confident the aim can be achieved.
While the possibility of an eventual return
to National Service in some form
cannot be entirely discounted, he does
not agree that the point has been reached
where this need even be considered. If
National Service is ever resorted to,
engagement would probably have to be for
three years.
