The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
different in principle to the new defence statement.
They accept American nuclear bases, and also
the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
until some future date. They deceive the people
by their talk of political and collective control
of Nato. The Pentagon has made it perfectly
clear who controls the American H-bomb, and
who will actually give the instructions to press
the button for nuclear warfare.
