The play was no more than a figment of
the imagination which asked the viewer to
believe in a beautiful ghost. It would have been
an impossible piece of television but for clever
production by Michael Hayes. He captured
the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great
effect. MORE than 100 viewers complained to
the B B C last night that an American film,
&quot;Britain - Blood, Sweat, and Tears... Plus
Twenty Years,&quot; was anti-British.
